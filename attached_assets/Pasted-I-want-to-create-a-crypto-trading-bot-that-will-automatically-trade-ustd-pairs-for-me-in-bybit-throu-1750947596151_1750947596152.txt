I want to create a crypto trading bot that will automatically trade ustd pairs for me in bybit through the bybit api, the base currency will always be usdt. there must be 2 selections on the dashboard 

1) for spot buy where it analyse the market and automatically buy a crypto asset with usdt and sell it for profit 

2) where it does leverage trading automatically using usdt to long and or short trades  

so the home page I must be able to choose between spot and leverage trading 

For reach spot trading and leverage trading I need the following tabs

 
Dashboard 
Symbol = ie. USDT/BTC
Direction = UP for spot trading and Long or Short for leverage trading 
Entry = entry price
Stop loss = where stop loss is set at
Take profit = where take profit is set at 
Quantity = qty bought for spot trading and qty long or short for leverage trading
Current Price = updated current price 
Status = is trade still open or closed 
PnL = current profit loss
Action = option to sell at market price in spot trading and option to close position for leverage trading  

Summary
I need another tab with comprehensive Summary that shows all trades taken how much was loss trades how much was won trades and how much is still open 

Bot Log
I need a active log tab that show what the trading bot is doing ie checking trade setup/ trade taken/ monitoring trade/ no trade signal/ trade score/ etc. 

System Error
I need a system error tab that show any trade errors or api errors or webhook errors 

Settings 
I need a settings tab to change the following 
how much usdt to use per trade 
Change indicator parameters, ie RSI, EMA, etc.
Ddd bybit api key and details to link the live api to bybit

here is options to consider when building the algorithm for the bot when using spot buy and when using leverage long or short 


üß≠ By Trading Style

‚Ä¢	Entry: On pullbacks or breakouts aligned with trend.
‚Ä¢	Exit: Trailing stop, opposite signal, or break of trendline.

2. Mean Reversion
"Buy low, sell high" ‚Äî expect price to return to the average.
‚Ä¢	Goal: Trade reversals or pullbacks from extremes.
‚Ä¢	Timeframe: Short to mid-term.
‚Ä¢	Indicators: RSI (<30 or >70), Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, Z-score.
‚Ä¢	Entry: When price deviates significantly from average.
‚Ä¢	Exit: When price reverts to mean (e.g., back to EMA or VWAP).


3. Breakout Trading
"Capture explosive moves."
‚Ä¢	Goal: Enter early into a strong move when price breaks out of a range or level.
‚Ä¢	Timeframe: Intraday to swing.
‚Ä¢	Indicators: Price action, volume, ORB (Opening Range Breakout), Donchian Channels.
‚Ä¢	Entry: Above resistance or below support.

We are using Puppeteer to automate interaction with the DeepSeek chat website.
 The issue might be due to several reasons: 
 1. The website structure might have changed, so selectors might not work.
 2. The website might have anti-bot measures.
 3. The initialization might fail due to environment issues (like missing Chrome).
 4. The response parsing might fail because the AI response doesn't match the expected format.
 Let's break down the code and see potential issues:
 1. Initialization:
    - We are launching a headless browser with specific options for an Ubuntu server.
    - We set a user agent and navigate to the DeepSeek chat URL.
 2. Analyzing market data:
    - We construct a prompt and try to input it into the textarea.
    - We press Enter and wait for 5 seconds for the response.
    - We then try to extract the latest message.
 3. Potential problems:
    a. The DeepSeek website might require login or might have changed the URL.
    b. The selectors for the textarea and messages might be incorrect.
    c. The wait time of 5 seconds might not be enough for the AI to respond.
    d. The response format might not be as expected, causing parsing to fail.
 4. Since the bot does not start when enabling DeepSeek AI, it's likely that the initialization is failing.
 Steps to debug:
 1. Check the console for errors during initialization.
 2. Ensure that the environment has the correct Chrome binary (if running on Ubuntu, the path should be correct).
 3. Check if the DeepSeek chat website is accessible from the server and doesn't require a login.
 Let's look at the initialization code:
   - We are using `puppeteer.launch` with a lot of args to avoid common issues in headless mode.
   - We set the user agent to mimic a real browser.
 5. Another possibility: the DeepSeek chat website might have a different structure in headless mode?
 6. We are waiting for a selector 'textarea' with a timeout of 30 seconds. If that fails, the initialization will throw.
 7. We are also using a selector for messages: '[data-testid="chat-message"]' and then fallback to '.message'. 
    These might not be the correct selectors.
 8. Since the problem is that the bot does not start, it's likely that the `initialize` method is throwing an error.
 9. We should add more logging to see where exactly it fails.
 10. Also, note that the DeepSeek website might block automated access.
 Given the complexity, let's try to improve the code with better error handling and logging.
 However, note that the problem might be due to the fact that the DeepSeek chat is not designed for automation.
 Alternative approach: use DeepSeek API if available, instead of web scraping.
 Since we don't have an API, we have to rely on scraping.
 Let's try to simulate more human-like behavior:
   - Wait for a random amount of time between actions.
   - Use more specific selectors.
 But first, let's check the current DeepSeek chat website to see the correct selectors.
 Since I cannot browse the website, I have to rely on the provided code.
 Let's assume the selectors are correct.
 Another idea: maybe the website uses iframes? Then we would need to switch to the iframe.
 Let's add a step to check if there's an iframe.
 However, without knowing the current structure, it's hard.
 We can take a screenshot when we navigate to the page to see what's going wrong.
 Modify the code to take a screenshot on initialization:
   await this.page.goto(this.chatUrl, { waitUntil: 'networkidle2' });
   await this.page.screenshot({ path: 'deepseek_init.png' });
 Then we can see if the page loaded correctly.
 Also, we can try to run the code in non-headless mode first to see what happens.
 Since the problem is in a production Ubuntu server, we might have to run it in headless.
 Let's try to run the code in headless:false in a development environment to see if it works.
 If it works in non-headless, then the issue is with headless mode.
 If it doesn't, then the issue is with the selectors or the website structure.
 Given the time, I'll suggest some changes:
 1. Increase the timeout for waiting for the response.
 2. Use more robust selectors by looking at the actual structure of the DeepSeek chat.
 3. Add retries for failed operations.
 However, note that the problem is that the bot does not start, so it's likely in the initialization.
 Let's check the initialization step by step.
 We are launching the browser, then navigating, then waiting for a textarea.
 If the textarea is not found, we throw an error.
 So, the error is likely that the textarea is not found.
 Reasons:
   - The page didn't load correctly.
   - The textarea is inside an iframe.
   - The textarea has a different selector.
 Let's modify the code to wait for the textarea with a longer timeout and log the page content if it fails.
 We can also try to wait for the body and then check the entire HTML.
 Alternatively, we can use a different selector: maybe the textarea has a specific class or id.
 Since I don't have the current HTML, I can only guess.
 Let's change the selector to a more generic one and wait for multiple elements.
 Alternatively, we can use the following to check if the page has loaded:
   await this.page.waitForFunction(() => document.readyState === 'complete');
 But note: the website might be a single-page app, so we are using 'networkidle2'.
 Another idea: the website might have a cookie consent or a welcome popup that blocks the textarea.
 We might need to dismiss it.
 Given the complexity, I would recommend:
   - Using a try-catch in the initialization and log the error.
   - Taking a screenshot to see what's on the page.
 Let's update the initialization code to take a screenshot on error.
 We'll also add a step to check for iframes.
 Since the code is for a trading bot, we must be cautious.
 However, without knowing the exact issue, it's hard to fix.
 Let's try to improve the code with the following:
   - Better error logging with screenshots.
   - Check for iframes and switch to them if needed.
 But note: the problem might be that the DeepSeek website requires JavaScript and we are blocking it? 
   We are not blocking JavaScript, so that shouldn't be an issue.
 Let's look at the args: we are disabling web security and other features, but JavaScript should be enabled.
 Another idea: the website might be detecting headless browsers.
 We can try to use puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth to avoid detection.
 However, that would require an additional package.
 Given the constraints, let's try to add a stealth plugin if possible.
 But first, let's try to run without headless to see if it works.
 If you can run the bot in a non-headless environment (like your local machine) and see if it works, that would help.
 If it works locally, then the issue is with the server environment.
 If it doesn't work locally, then the issue is with the code.
 Since I cannot run the code, I have to make assumptions.
 Let's assume the DeepSeek website has changed and now requires login.
 Then we would need to handle authentication.
 But the code doesn't provide any authentication.
 So, if the website now requires login, we have to update the code to log in.
 Alternatively, the URL might be wrong.
 Let's check the URL: 'https://chat.deepseek.com/' - is this still the correct URL?
 Steps to fix:
 1. Check the URL is correct and accessible from the server.
 2. Check the initialization by taking a screenshot.
 3. If the page shows a login form, then we need to handle authentication.
 Without more information, it's hard to pinpoint the exact issue.
 However, I can suggest some code improvements to make it more robust:
   - Use page.waitForNetworkIdle() after navigation.
   - Check for common popups and close them.
   - Use more specific selectors by inspecting the DeepSeek chat website.
 Let's update the code to use a more specific selector for the textarea.
 After looking at the DeepSeek chat website (as of the time of writing), the textarea has an attribute `data-id` or something.
 But without the current structure, we cannot know.
 Alternatively, we can use the following to find the textarea:
   await this.page.waitForSelector('textarea[placeholder*="Message"]', { timeout: 30000 });
 This waits for a textarea that has a placeholder containing "Message".
 Similarly, for the messages, we can use:
   await this.page.waitForSelector('.message', { timeout: 15000 });
 But again, this is guesswork.
 Given the complexity, I recommend:
   - Running the bot in a non-headless environment first to see if it works.
   - Taking screenshots during initialization to see what's happening.
 Let's update the code to take a screenshot in the initialization:
   await this.page.screenshot({ path: 'initialization.png' });
 Then we can see if the page loaded correctly.
 Also, we can log the page title and URL to ensure we are on the right page.
 We'll add:
   console.log('Page title:', await this.page.title());
   console.log('Page URL:', await this.page.url());
 This might help.
 If the page is not loading correctly, we might need to handle redirects or login.
 Since the problem is critical, we must find a way to debug.
 Let's update the initialization code with more logging and a screenshot.
 We'll also add a try-catch around the textarea waiting.
 Code changes:
   try {
     await this.page.waitForSelector('textarea', { timeout: 30000 });
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Textarea not found. Taking screenshot...');
     await this.page.screenshot({ path: 'textarea_error.png' });
     throw error;
   }
 This will help us see what's on the page when the textarea is not found.
 Similarly, we can do for the response.
 Given the time, I'll provide the updated code with more logging and screenshots.
 However, note that taking screenshots on a server might require a display, but in headless mode, it should work.
 Let's update the code accordingly.
 We'll also increase the timeouts and add retries for sending the message.
 But note: the problem is that the bot does not start, so it's in the initialization.
 Let's focus on the initialization.
 Updated initialization code with more logging and screenshot on error:
   async initialize(): Promise<void> {
     try {
       console.log('Initializing DeepSeek AI service...');
       
       const browserOptions = {
         headless: true,
         executablePath: process.env.CHROME_BIN || '/usr/bin/chromium-browser',
         args: [
           '--no-sandbox',
           '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
           '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
           '--disable-accelerated-2d-canvas',
           '--no-first-run',
           '--no-zygote',
           '--single-process',
           '--disable-gpu',
           '--disable-extensions',
           '--disable-background-timer-throttling',
           '--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows',
           '--disable-renderer-backgrounding',
           '--disable-features=TranslateUI',
           '--disable-web-security',
           '--disable-features=VizDisplayCompositor'
         ]
       };
       this.browser = await puppeteer.launch(browserOptions);
       this.page = await this.browser.newPage();
       
       await this.page.setUserAgent(
         'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/121.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'
       );
       console.log('Navigating to DeepSeek chat...');
       await this.page.goto(this.chatUrl, { waitUntil: 'networkidle2', timeout: 60000 });
       
       console.log('Waiting for chat interface to load...');
       // Wait for the textarea
       try {
         await this.page.waitForSelector('textarea', { timeout: 30000 });
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Textarea not found within 30 seconds. Taking screenshot...');
         await this.page.screenshot({ path: 'deepseek_textarea_error.png' });
         throw new Error('Chat input (textarea) not found after page load');
       }
       
       this.isInitialized = true;
       console.log('DeepSeek AI service initialized successfully');
       
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Failed to initialize DeepSeek AI service:', error);
       // Take screenshot for debugging
       if (this.page) {
         await this.page.screenshot({ path: 'deepseek_init_error.png' });
       }
       this.isInitialized = false;
       throw error;
     }
   }
 Similarly, we can update the `getLatestResponse` method to take a screenshot if it fails.
 This will help us debug.
 If the issue persists, we might have to use a different approach.
 Alternatively, we can use the DeepSeek API if they have one, but I don't think they have a public API for this.
 Another idea: use a different AI chat model that has an API (like OpenAI's GPT) for trading analysis.
 But that would require changing the entire service.
 Given the time, I hope the above steps will help you debug the issue.
 Let me know if you need more help.
Based on your code, I can identify several potential issues that might prevent your DeepSeek AI trading bot from starting. Here are the key areas to investigate:

1. Puppeteer Configuration Issues
Chrome/Chromium Path: The executable path might be incorrect on your Ubuntu server.

Missing Dependencies: Headless Chrome might require additional system dependencies.

2. DeepSeek Website Changes
Selector Mismatch: The DeepSeek chat interface might have updated, breaking your selectors.

Anti-Bot Measures: DeepSeek might have protections against automated access.

3. Response Parsing Failures
Format Mismatch: The AI's response might not match your expected format, causing parsing errors.

4. Timing Issues
Insufficient Wait Times: 5 seconds might not be enough for the AI to generate a response.

🔧 Recommended Fixes
1. Update Puppeteer Configuration
typescript
const browserOptions = {
  headless: "new", // Use newer headless mode
  executablePath: process.env.CHROME_BIN || 
    '/usr/bin/google-chrome' || // Try common Chrome paths
    '/usr/bin/chromium-browser',
  args: [
    '--no-sandbox',
    '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
    '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
    '--disable-gpu',
    '--no-first-run',
    '--no-zygote',
    '--disable-extensions'
  ]
};
2. Add Error Handling for Initialization
typescript
async initialize(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    // ... existing code ...
    await this.page.goto(this.chatUrl, { 
      waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded', // More reliable than networkidle2
      timeout: 60000 
    });
    
    // Wait for both textarea and any consent popups
    await Promise.race([
      this.page.waitForSelector('textarea', { timeout: 30000 }),
      this.page.waitForSelector('button:contains("Accept")', { timeout: 30000 })
    ]);
    
    // Handle consent popups if present
    const acceptButton = await this.page.$('button:contains("Accept")');
    if (acceptButton) {
      await acceptButton.click();
      await this.page.waitForTimeout(2000);
    }
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Initialization failed:', error);
    // Add screenshot for debugging
    await this.page?.screenshot({ path: 'init-error.png' });
    throw error;
  }
}
3. Improve Response Handling
typescript
private async getLatestResponse(): Promise<string> {
  // Add multiple fallback selectors
  const selectors = [
    '[data-testid="chat-message"]',
    '.message',
    '.chat-message',
    '[class*="message"]',
    '[class*="chat"]'
  ];
  
  for (const selector of selectors) {
    try {
      await this.page!.waitForSelector(selector, { timeout: 10000 });
      const messages = await this.page!.$$eval(selector, elements => 
        elements.map(el => el.textContent?.trim() || '')
      );
      if (messages.length > 0) return messages[messages.length - 1];
    } catch (e) {
      continue;
    }
  }
  throw new Error('No response found with any selector');
}
4. Add Better Debugging
typescript
async analyzeMarketData(...) {
  try {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Add debug screenshot
    await this.page!.screenshot({ path: 'debug-prompt.png' });
    
    // Wait for response with more flexibility
    await this.page!.waitForFunction(
      () => document.querySelectorAll('[class*="message"]').length % 2 === 0,
      { timeout: 30000 }
    );
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Analysis error:', error);
    await this.page!.screenshot({ path: 'analysis-error.png' });
    throw error;
  }
}
5. Verify Dependencies
On your Ubuntu server, install required dependencies:

bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  chromium-browser \
  libxss1 \
  libappindicator3-1 \
  libindicator7 \
  fonts-liberation \
  libasound2 \
  libnspr4 \
  libnss3 \
  libx11-xcb1 \
  libxcomposite1 \
  libxcursor1 \
  libxdamage1 \
  libxi6 \
  libxtst6 \
  xdg-utils
6. Alternative Approach: API Integration
Consider using DeepSeek's official API if available, as it would be more reliable than web scraping:

typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const deepseek = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://api.deepseek.com/v1',
  apiKey: process.env.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
});
🚀 Next Steps
Test Initialization: Run just the initialization part to check if Puppeteer can launch

Check Screenshots: Examine the generated screenshots to see what's happening

Verify Selectors: Manually inspect the DeepSeek website to confirm selectors

Monitor Console: Check for any browser console errors using:

typescript
this.page!.on('console', msg => console.log('Puppeteer log:', msg.text()));
If the issue persists after these changes, consider:
